This used to be two high schooler's attempt at making a refresh for our high school's Flexible Access system, aiming to replace Flexisched. This project has been abandoned in favor of [Nize]([url](https://nize.education/)https://nize.education/). 

This repo currently contains nothing but a semi functional front end and some back end code.
